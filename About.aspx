            <p>Hello! I'm <strong>Alex Johnson</strong>, a web developer, designer, and technology enthusiast. With a passion for all things digital, I specialize in creating interactive, responsive, and user-focused websites that not only look great but also perform exceptionally well. My journey into web development started over five years ago, and since then, I've helped individuals and businesses across various industries create their digital presence.</p>

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>I began my professional career as a graphic designer, creating branding and visual identities for startups. Over time, I became fascinated by the technical side of things—how design can be brought to life on the web. That’s when I made the transition into web development. I studied web technologies and honed my skills by working on personal projects and taking on freelance gigs. Today, I blend both design and development to create unique digital experiences.</p>

I focus on clean, modular code that’s easy to maintain and scale. I also believe that collaboration is key—I enjoy working closely with my clients to understand their vision and objectives, ensuring that the final product exceeds expectations.</p>

            <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
            <p>When I'm not coding or designing, I enjoy staying active and exploring the outdoors. On weekends, you’ll often find me hiking the trails around the Bay Area or enjoying a good game of basketball with friends. I’m also a bit of a coffee connoisseur and love discovering new coffee shops.</p>
